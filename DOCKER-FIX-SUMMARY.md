# STMS Docker Container Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Docker container for the STMS TALL stack project was failing to start due to nginx configuration errors. The original setup had several issues:

1. **Version Mismatch**: Dockerfile specified PHP 8.2 instead of the required PHP 8.3.23
2. **Missing Dependencies**: `libonig-dev` package was missing, causing `mbstring` extension build to fail
3. **Nginx Configuration Error**: Invalid `gzip_proxied` directive containing unsupported `must-revalidate` value
4. **Web Server Conflict**: Mixed configuration attempting to use both Apache and nginx

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Dockerfile
- Changed base image from `php:8.2-apache` to `php:8.3-fpm`
- Added missing `libonig-dev` dependency for `mbstring` extension
- Switched from Apache to nginx + PHP-FPM for better performance
- Added proper supervisor configuration to manage processes
- Enhanced startup script with configuration testing and Laravel optimization

### 2. Fixed Nginx Configuration
- Corrected `gzip_proxied` directive by removing invalid `must-revalidate` value
- Properly configured nginx to work with PHP-FPM

### 3. Added PHP-FPM Configuration
- Created proper PHP-FPM pool configuration
- Set appropriate user permissions and process management

### 4. Enhanced Startup Process
- Added nginx and PHP-FPM configuration validation
- Included Laravel application key generation
- Added cache optimization commands
- Improved error handling and logging

### 5. Updated Docker Compose
- Added health check configuration
- Set proper environment variables
- Added APP_KEY environment variable

## Container Architecture
The final setup uses:
- **PHP 8.3-FPM**: For PHP processing
- **Nginx**: As web server (instead of Apache)
- **Supervisor**: To manage multiple processes
- **Node.js 18**: For frontend asset building

## Services Running
1. **nginx**: Web server on port 80
2. **php-fpm**: PHP FastCGI Process Manager
3. **laravel-queue**: Laravel queue worker for background jobs

## Key Files Modified
- `Dockerfile`: Complete rewrite for nginx + PHP-FPM setup
- `docker/nginx.conf`: Fixed gzip configuration
- `docker/php-fpm.conf`: New PHP-FPM pool configuration  
- `docker/supervisord.conf`: Enhanced process management
- `docker-compose.yml`: Added health checks and environment variables

## Testing Results
✅ Container builds successfully
✅ All services start without errors  
✅ Nginx configuration validates
✅ PHP-FPM configuration validates
✅ Health endpoint responds (200 OK)

## Commands to Use

### Use Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
# Start all services (app, database, redis)
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f app
docker-compose logs -f db

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Use Management Scripts
**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
# Start everything
.\docker-manage.ps1 -Command start

# Check logs
.\docker-manage.ps1 -Command logs -Service app

# Stop everything
.\docker-manage.ps1 -Command stop
```

**Bash (Linux/Mac):**
```bash
# Start everything
./docker-manage.sh start

# Check logs
./docker-manage.sh logs app

# Stop everything
./docker-manage.sh stop
```

### Build and Run Individual Container (Not Recommended)
```bash
docker build -t stms-app .
docker run -p 8080:80 stms-app
# Note: This won't have database connectivity
```

## Database Setup
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0
- **Host**: localhost:3306 (from host machine) or `db:3306` (from app container)
- **Database Name**: stms
- **Username**: stms_user
- **Password**: stms_password
- **Root Password**: root_password

The database is automatically initialized and migrations run on first startup.

The container now starts successfully and all services run properly without the nginx failures that were occurring before.
